# FreeFang
 A free implementation of the Werewolf game in python.
 Currently in beta, however it is usable and all core features are implemented.

# Features

- Full werewolf experience with quite a few roles to pick from.  
- No moderator needed, the server takes care of everything from role attribution to voting to role actions.  
- Create a custom ruleset on game creation with only the roles you want.  
- No signup, enter a server, game id, pick a name and you're good.  
- Selfhostable, git clone, run freefang/main.py, done. No dependencies. Very simple to get started with.
